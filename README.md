## Introduction
Image colorization is the process of converting grayscale images into colored images, enhancing their visual appeal and providing more information. This project utilizes the Pix2Pix GAN framework, a popular model for image-to-image translation tasks.

## Project Goals
1. Refresh Python programming skills.
2. Understand the basics of neural networks.
3. Learn and implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
4. Study and apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), particularly Pix2Pix.
5. Train and evaluate a Pix2Pix GAN model for image colorization.
6. Deploy the trained model and create a user-friendly interface for image colorization.
